# Cookbook

This folder contains some examples for accomplishing specific tasks with RSpace API.

All the examples will use placeholders for your API key and RSpace URL.
On a Bash shell, you can set these as environment variables, for example:

```bash
export API_KEY=mysecretkey
export RSPACE_URL=https://REPLACE.researchspace.com/api/v1
```

So if you have an account on RSpace Community, RSPACE_URL should be `https://community.researchspace.com/api/v1`
