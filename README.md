# api-tutorial

## Introduction

This project provides an introduction to using the RSpace API.

### Who is this tutorial for?

For software developers, or scientists with programming or scripting skills, to learn how to use the
RSpace API to interact programmatically with the RSpace Electronic Lab Notebook.

### How does this tutorial fit in with other RSpace API documentation?

* The [RSpace help documentation](http://www.researchspace.com/help-and-support-resources/rspace-api-introduction/)
  describes how to get your API token from the RSpace UI.
* The [API technical reference](https://community.researchspace.com/public/apiDocs)
  describes low-level technical details of the API endpoints
  and API contracts.
* [Example code projects](https://github.com/rspace-os) provide language-specific API client example code. 

### What version of RSpace is required for this tutorial?

RSpace 1.56 or newer is needed to follow all the steps.

### Use-cases for the API

 * Uploading files from instruments or your device into RSpace automatically.
 * Creating RSpace documents and linking to files.
 * Adding or editing content in an RSpace document.
 * Searching and retrieving files and documents
 * Creating folders and notebooks for organising content.
 * Creating and publishing forms
 * Sharing RSpace documents
 * Importing MSWord or OpenOffice documents into RSpace
 * Scheduled exports of your work.
 
### Getting started
* Follow the instructions in the [RSpace help documentation](http://www.researchspace.com/help-and-support-resources/rspace-api-introduction/)
  to get set up with an API key for your account.
* This tutorial will use `curl` commands to make API calls rather than assume a particular programming language.

Code examples are shown in the following syntax:

    curl -v -H "accept: application/json" -H "apiKey:<APIKEY>"  "<RSPACE_URL>/api/v1/files"
    
 * The `-v` option to curl shows verbose information about the request to help you debug any problems.
 * You generally need to supply the content type to be accepted, and your API key, as request headers. Replace '<APIKEY'>
   with your own key.
 * Replace <RSPACE_URL> with the base URL of your RSpace installation. E.g. if you're using RSpace Community, this 
   would be `https://community.researchspace.com`.
 * Any other text in <ANGLE_BRACKETS> is a placeholder for a value specific to your account, e.g. a resource identifier. 
   
All code snippets are provided as working examples in the `tutorial-data` folders in this project.
 

## Creating content

### Uploading files

Being able to upload a file to RSpace automatically can save you a lot of time and effort compared to manually uploading files
using the web application. You can perform tasks such as:

 * Bulk upload of files
 * Scheduled upload of files, e.g. files generated by an instrument, sequence  files, image files etc

The simplest way to upload a file is as follows:

    curl -v  -X POST -H "accept: application/json" -H "apiKey: <APIKEY>" \
    -H "content-type: multipart/form-data" -F "file=@<MY_FILE.txt>" \
     "<RSPACE_URL>/api/v1/files"
     
This will upload a file '<MY_FILE.txt>'  a  default folder called 'Api Inbox' in the relevant section
 of the Gallery. This folder will be automatically created for you if it doesn't yet exist. JSON will be returned:

    {
      "id" : 728,
      "globalId" : "GL728",
      "name" : "<MY_FILE.txt>",
      "caption" : "",
      "contentType" : "text/plain",
      "created" : "2017-07-23T09:54:16.007Z",
      "size" : 2812,
      "_links" : [ {
         "link" : "<RSPACE_URL>/api/v1/files/728",
         "rel" : "self"
       }, {
         "link" : "<RSPACE_URL>/api/v1/files/728/file",
         "rel" : "enclosure"
      } ]
    }
    
 The `_links` property contains pre-generated links to resources created or referenced in API calls. In this case, the 'self'
  link will return the file metadata, and the 'enclosure' link will download the file contents. These will be described later.
    
 You can also upload a file with an optional caption, and also specify a folder to put the file in.
 
     curl -v  -X POST -H "accept: application/json" -H "apiKey: <APIKEY>" \
     -H "content-type: multipart/form-data" -F "file=@<MY_FILE.txt>" -F"folderId=<FOLDER_ID>\
     -F "caption=some metadata about this file" \"<RSPACE_URL>/api/v1/files"
     
 The caption will appear in the 'Info' section of each Gallery item, and just like a manually edited caption, will be searchable.
 This is a good way to add some descriptive metadata to your file so that you can locate it easily.
 
 As of 1.50, browsing folders via the API is not yet supported. However it's very easy to get a folder ID from RSpace by clicking
  on the 'info' icon beside a Gallery folder.
 
 **Note:** There are some restrictions on which folders you can upload to. For example, if uploading image files, a folder ID must
  be either the Gallery Images folder, or a subfolder of the images folder. You can't upload a file directly into a workspace folder
   or notebook.
   
 If you're uploading many files of mixed type, then it's probably safer not to specify a single folder, but to let them be 
 placed in the relevant `API Inbox` folder where you can organise them later.
 
 #### Uploading files from a folder.
 
 The script [batchUpload.sh](tutorial-data/uploading-a-file-1/batchUpload.sh) will upload files sequentially from a list
 on the command line, e.g.
 
     # upload a single file
     ./batchUpload.sh myFile.txt
     # upload all png files in folder
     ./batchUpload.sh `ls *.png`
     
### Downloading files

You can download files from RSpace to your device using the following syntax:

    curl -v  -H "accept:application/octet-stream" -H "apiKey:<APIKEY>" "<RSPACE_URL>/api/v1/files/<FILE_ID>/file"
 
### Creating documents

You can create documents of different types, and add content to some or all of the fields.
Some of the examples use JSON request bodies - files of JSON data are in  [this project](tutorial-data/creatingDocument).

#### Creating a basic document.

This is the simplest way to create a document - it will be a 'Basic Document' (a single text field) with default name 'Untitled Document' and
 no content. Note that an empty request body '-d {}' is required.
 
    curl -X POST -H "content-type: application/json" -H "apiKey:<APIKEY>" -d {} "<RSPACE_URL>/api/v1/documents"
    
This example is a little more useful - creating a named, tagged Basic Document with some content:

    curl -X POST -H "content-type: application/json" -H "apiKey:<APIKEY>" \
       -d "@tutorial-data/creatingDocument/basicDocument-named-withContent.json" \
       "<RSPACE_URL>/api/v1/documents"
       
#### Creating links in documents to files

If you want to create links to files in a document's content, you can easily do this by adding a tag with the syntax:

    <fileId=1234>
    
  to your document content, e.g. replacing '1234' with the id of your file. RSpace will then create links in exactly the same way
  as it does in the UI. E.g.
    
    {
      "name": "My Experiment",
      "tags": "API,example",
      "fields": [
         {
           "content": "Protocol as described in <fileId=1234>, except using EDTA 3uM. "
         }
        ]
    }

### Creating notebooks and folders

From RSpace 1.50 (API version 1.4) you can create notebooks and folders.

    curl -X POST "<RSPACE_URL>/api/v1/folders" -H "accept: application/json" -H "apiKey: <APIKEY>" \
    -H "content-type: application/json" \
    -d "{ \"name\": \"My notebook\", \"notebook\": \"true\"}"
    
will create a new Notebook in your Home folder. If you prefer to create a folder just set the notebook parameter to 'false'. Or,just omit the parameter - the default behaviour is to create a folder.

You can also create a new folder or notebook in an existing folder using the `parentFolderId` parameter, e.g.

    curl -X POST "<RSPACE_URL>/api/v1/folders" -H "accept: application/json" -H "apiKey: <APIKEY>" \
     -H "content-type: application/json"\
     -d "{ \"name\": \"My notebook\", \"parentFolderId\":\"12234\"}"
    
There are some restrictions on where you can create folders and notebooks, which are required to  maintain consistent behaviour
 with the web application. 

* You can't create folders or notebooks inside notebooks
* You can't create notebooks inside the Shared Folder; create them in a User folder first, then share. (Sharing is not yet supported in the API, but you can do this in the web application).

## Editing existing content in a basic document

You can alter the content of an existing document using a `PUT` request to the `/documents/{docId}` endpoint. The new
content will replace existing content. If someone else is editing the document, then the request will fail,
returning a `409 Conflict` error code.  

You just include in the request body the data that you want to change - any/all of name, tags and field content.

    curl -v  -X PUT -H "content-type: application/json" -H "apiKey: <APIKEY>"\
      -d "@tutorial-data/editingDocument/editBasicDocument.json"  "<RSPACE_URL>/api/v1/documents/<DOC_ID>"
      
## Creating and editing multi-field documents.

Now we know how to  create simple documents, let's consider multi-field of 'Structured Documents' that contain 
 fields of different types as defined by a Form. You can add/edit content to any or all of the fields.
 
In this section we'll be using the standard 'Experiment' form that is already defined for you in RSpace. It contains
 7 text fields: Method, Objective, Procedure, Results, Discussion, Conclusion, Comment.
 
 You'll need to get the ID of the form from the UI, and include this ID as in the  'form' property in the request body.
 When adding content, the order is important. If for example, you just want to add content to the 'Procedure' field,
  which is the 3rd field, then supply a list of 7 fields, of which only the 3rd has some data, e.g.
  
    curl -X POST -H "content-type: application/json" -H "apiKey:<APIKEY>" \
      -d "@tutorial-data/creatingDocument/complexDocument-named-withContent.json" "<RSPACE_URL>/api/v1/documents"
 
 When editing content, there are two options. Either you can send the data as a list of all fields, as for POST, including content
  as necessary, or you can reference a field by its ID, and just send values for 
  [those specific fields](tutorial-data/editingDocument/editComplexDocument-named-withFieldIds.json).
  
    curl -v  -X PUT -H "content-type: application/json" -H "apiKey: <APIKEY>"\
      -d "@tutorial-data/editingDocument/editComplexDocument-named-withFieldIds.json"\
      "<RSPACE_URL>/api/v1/documents/<DOC_ID>"
      
 As for BasicDocuments, you can also edit name and tags in the request body as well.

## Deleting content
 
 You can mark documents  as deleted. This behaves in the same way as the web UI - documents are not completely removed
  but are merely hidden from listings and search results. This is a simple call that takes single path variable, the ID
  of the document to delete:
  
    curl -v  -X DELETE  -H "apiKey: <APIKEY>"\
      "<RSPACE_URL>/api/v1/documents/<DOC_ID>"
      
and in a similar way you can delete whole notebooks or folders as well:

    curl -v  -X DELETE  -H "apiKey: <APIKEY>"\
      "<RSPACE_URL>/api/v1/folders/<DOC_ID>"
      
In both these cases, if a notebook or document was previously shared, then they will be unshared as part of the deletion process.
  
## Sharing Content

From RSpace 1.56, it is possible 
 
## Forms

### Listing forms

From RSpace 1.50 (API version 1.4) you can list and search for Forms. The search mechanism replicates what is used 
in the 'Manage Forms' page in the web application.

To list all Forms:
      
    curl -X GET "<RSPACE_URL>/api/v1/forms" -H "accept: application/json" -H "apiKey: <APIKEY>"
    
As for documents and files, you can order and paginate:

    curl -X GET "<RSPACE_URL>/api/v1/forms?pageSize=10&orderBy=lastModified%20desc" \
       -H "accept: application/json" -H "apiKey: <APIKEY>"
       
Searching is by freeform wildcard search for all or part of the `name` or `tag` property of the form.

    curl -X GET "<RSPACE_URL>/api/v1/forms?query=Algal%20Sample" \
       -H "accept: application/json" -H "apiKey: <APIKEY>"
       
The search results contain summary information about each form, but does not contain the list of Field definitions. If you want to get this information, then get a single Form by its ID, e.g.

    curl -X GET "<RSPACE_URL>/api/v1/forms/<ID>" \
       -H "accept: application/json" -H "apiKey: <APIKEY>"
       
Please see [Form Help documentation](https://www.researchspace.com/enterprise/help-and-support-resources-enterprise/forms-enterprise/) for more details on how Forms are versioned and used in RSpace. As in the user interface, form searching retrieves the *current version* of a Form.

###  Creating new forms

You can create new forms through the API. Read more about this in [forms.md](forms.md)

## Exporting content

You can programmatically export your work in HTML or XML format. This 
might be useful if you want to make scheduled backups, for example. If you're an admin or PI you can export
a particular user's work if you have permission.

You can read more details in [jobs.md](jobs.md).

## Importing content

From RSpace 1.56, it is possible to import Microsoft Word or OpenOffice files as RSpace documents. This is the same functionality as the `Create->from Word` feature in the web application.

The API calls are similar to those for uploading files - you'll need a Word/Office file, and optionally a folder ID that you want to import into:

    curl -X POST "<RSPACE_URL>/api/v1/import/word" -H "accept: application/json" 
    -H "apiKey: <APIKEY>" -H "content-type: multipart/form-data"
     -F "file=@<WORD_FILE>.doc;type=application/msword"
    
If you don't specify a folder ID, the RSpace document will be created in the 'Api Inbox' folder.

## Sharing items with other groups and users

From RSpace 1.56, it is possible to share documents and notebooks programmatically. You can read more details in [sharing.md](sharing.md).
